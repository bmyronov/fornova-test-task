## Fornava Test

## Before we start
Acording to the task to write test_runner I should have used Genymotion emulator or use Android phone.

After lots of tries and errors I wasn't able to run Tripadvisor app in Genymotion.
Acording to their documentation:

> If your application is not available in Google Play Store, or if you get the message ```This device isn't supported with this version```, it usually means that it is only available for ARM.
> In that case, please refer to the Applications for ARM/ARM64 section below.

I wans't able to test it on Mac with Arm processor and on the device with arm processor was able to run Genimotion.

So all the test were made on Android device.

I used Lenovo Tablet as my test device (for those who will try to recreate in emulator).
